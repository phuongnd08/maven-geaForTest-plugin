Maven Google App Engine Plugin (maven-gae-plugin)

 The maven-gae-plugin provides support for {{{http://code.google.com/appengine/}Google App Engine}} projects.
 Basically, it attempts to cover all the basic operations provided by Google App Engine SDK, such as 
 running project locally, deploying it to Google's cloud, retrieving production logs etc. 

* Goals overview

 The most commonly used (and most tested) goals are:
 
 * {{{run-mojo.html}gae:run}} for running project on a local server.
~~ * {{{debug-mojo.html}gae:debug}} for running project on a local server in the java debugging mode.
 * {{{deploy-mojo.html}gae:deploy}} for uploading project to the Google cloud.
